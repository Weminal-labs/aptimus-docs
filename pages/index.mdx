            To relieve your users from the complexities of Web3 technologies, you can utilize Aptimus to generate an Aptos address using a Web 2.0 login. End users can log in through familiar Web 2.0 systems, such as Google, and seamlessly perform transactions on the Aptos network. The process of creating an Aptos address is managed on their behalf and is linked to their Web 2.0 credentials.

            Aptimus uses keyless to generate self-custodial Aptos addresses, with
            just a simple web credential login. Using the OAuth2 OpenID Connect
            standard, users can sign in with Google, Apple and more. The
            user's on-chain address is linked to an active JSON Web Token (JWT)
            from their web credential. Aptimus generates a salt and address, using{" "}

              Aptimus empowers developers to fully sponsor transactions for end
              users, while the Aptimus Developer Portal offers the essential
              tools to set up and manage these transactions. By taking advantage
              of these features, you can cover transaction fees on the Aptos
              network for your users, simplifying their experience by
              eliminating the need for them to understand gas fees or even be
              aware of what an Aptos token is or that they are engaging with a
              blockchain. This approach allows you to control revenue collection
              and keeps your users focused on the advantages of your app rather
              than its Web3 components.
