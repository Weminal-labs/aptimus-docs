Aptimus provides several HTTP APIs, which expose all of the core Aptimus functionality. Our API accepts JSON-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication.

**Base URL:** []()

**Versioned Base URL:** []()

## Authentication

The Aptimus API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in the Aptimus Developer Portal. You can create both private and public API keys. Public keys are meant to be used when calling Aptimus from a frontend or used in publicly available code. If you're calling the API from a backend service instead, use either a public or private API key to construct your `Authorization` header. The benefit of using a private key is to avoid public key rate limits. Format the header as follows:

```
Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_APTIMUS_API_KEY>
```
